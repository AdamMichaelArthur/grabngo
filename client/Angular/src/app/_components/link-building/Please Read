I am going to show you how to create a FlexTable.  The first thing that you need to understand is this: what data am I going to be displaying in my
flextable?

Do not even start with making a new flextable until you understand this.

The flextable supports display almost any data that you can get from the database

You can even use mongo aggregate commands for the data you need.

So the first step is to make sure that you have created your mongodb queries.

You need to know the following information:

	What is your MongoDB collection?

	What, if any, find/filter commands will you use to get your data?

	Does the data you want to display require an aggregate find?

In our case that we're going to demonstrate right now, I want to create a flextable of "completed" bounties.

My collection is 'bounties' and my filter looks like this:

	db.bounties.find({published_link: {$exists: true}}).pretty()

So the first thing I need to do is run this command in the mongo shell to make sure it works.

As you can see, it does.  Next I'm going to decide on what columns I want to display.

I want to display "Brand Name", "Keywords", "Titles" and "Published Link".
