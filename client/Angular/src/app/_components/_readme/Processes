At the heart of Content Bounty is a database relationship we call a "process"

Processes are a series of steps that, when completed in order, complete a desired outcome.

Steps are individual components that specify a task, actions or series of action items that
complete a specific aspect of the end product.

Processes can be found in the "processes" collection
Steps can be found in the "steps" collection

How To Create A Process In The Database
---------------------------------------

1.	Create a document with the following characteristics:

	{
		"content_type" : "Short Form Article",
		"distribution_method" : [
			"Website,Platform,Document"
		],
		"editorial_guidelines" : [
			"http://www.dropboxurl.com/link/to/editorial/guidelines/link1",
			"http://www.dropboxurl.com/link/to/editorial/guidelines/link2",
			"http://www.dropboxurl.com/link/to/editorial/guidelines/link3"
		],
		"frequency" : [
			"Select Frequency",
			"2x Per Day",
			"3x Per Day",
			"4x Per Day",
			"Daily",
			"3x Per Week",
			"Weekly",
			"2x Per Month",
			"Monthly"
		],
		"media_type" : "text",
		"process_description" : "Find an interesting article related to our keywords",
		"short_description" : "Repost an image related to these keywords",
		"starting_day" : [
			"Select Day",
			"Monday",
			"Tuesday",
			"Wednesday",
			"Thursday",
			"Friday",
			"Saturday",
			"Sunday"
		],
		"suggested_bounty" : 125,
		"suggested_video_length" : 5,
		"suggested_word_count" : 1800,
	}

2.	Once a Process document is created, you must add 'steps' to this process in the 'steps' collection
	* Note there are a max of 100 steps for every process

	{
		"bounty" : 0,
		"content_type" : "Long Form Article",
		"display_pos" : 0,
		"editorial_guidelines" : [ ],
		"skills" : [
			"seo"
		],
		"stage" : "SEO",
		"step" : "Internal Linking",
		"step_description" : "Create internal links",
		"suggested_bounty" : 20,
		"types" : [
			"reviews"
		],
		"files" : [ ]
	}

3.	Steps will be displayed in the order they appear in the database.  If you want to re-arrange the the order in which steps are displayed,
you must delete all of the steps and re-insert them.  This behavior will be deprecated in the future, though, as we plan to add a field "step_display_order"
for this purpose.
